Demian\",\"Headline\":\"Well-made, bright, and good deal.\",\"Rating\":\"5.0 out of 5 stars\",\"Date\":\"on April 10, 2018\",\"Pattern\":\"Pattern: LED Flashlight 2P\",\"Comment\":\"Was this review helpful to you?\",\"TextRivew\":\"Wow. Nicely made. Work very well with Li Ion 14500 batteries as well as with AA alkaline (of course dimmer). Not hard to get used to the (stupid) inclusion of Strobe Mode. They automatically cycle from mode to mode each time you turn them off\\/on with the tail switch. Hint to make your life easier (such as it is): When (not if) it turns on automatically (every third time) in strobe mode, just gently push down slightly once or twice on the switch to make it cycle between modes to get what you want. Instead of \\\"jumping up and down, screaming and shouting\\\", just think ZEN thoughts (Ooooommmm. All is beauty) and gently depress the switch.\\n\\nAnd think of the amazingness of this: A bright (and cheap and well-made) LED flashlight that operates on one lousy battery at 1 1\\/2 volts (yes, even cheap light \\\"heavy duty\\\" non-alkalines) or an NiMH rechargeable at 1.35 volts and yet is still not destroyed by 3.7 volt Li Ion's. Would I be as enthusiastic if I'd not got them on sale at 6.99? Well, maybe a little less because the competition in quantity goes for about $3 to $4 per, and if I buy 5 or 6, I'd be giving away a few to friends and that would be even more fun.\\n\\nOne little nit-picky thing: the \\\"Two Fluorescent Rings Which Shine in the Dark Night\\\" (not fluorescent but phosphorescent) the \\\"rings\\\" seem to be just those (cheap) little silicone rubber bands sold in handi-craft stores that are woven together (mainly by younger people, it seems) to make rings and bracelets. Yeah, some of those are sold as glow-in-the-dark. My point is that after a few minutes in the dark, I've seen matches brighter than these -yeah UNLIT matches!\\n\\nOne more thing - if you use 14500 Li Ion batteries: EBL 14500 Li-ion Rechargeable Batteries 3.7V 800mAh for LED Flashlight Torch, 8 Packs most of these are what is called \\\"unprotected\\\". In this case, it means if their voltage goes down in the flashlight, they are probably going to be damaged and may never again be able to be charged to full capacity - or at all. So this is my suggestion: if the \\\"bulb\\\" starts dimming or shuts off by itself: immediately open the flashlight and take out the battery. That way the flashlight cannot draw down its voltage any more. Since there's no circuit to protect your battery, you have to do it. This should help you protect your investment and continue to give you the nice bright light these batteries give with these flashlights.\"},{\"CustomerName\":\"KMS Squared\",\"Headline\":\"Nice flashlight, Good value\",\"Rating\":\"5.0 out of 5 stars\",\"Date\":\"on April 10, 2018\",\"Pattern\":\"Pattern: 4 pack\",\"Comment\":\"Was this review helpful to you?\",\"TextRivew\":\"Nice flashlight, Good value\"},{\"CustomerName\":\"Michael\",\"Headline\":\"They work.

Was this review helpful to you?\",\"TextRivew\":\"Given my many prior, poor experiences with several of the low-price\\/knockoff CREE type LED, zoomable style flashlights I've bought of this design, these lights are a surprisingly good purchase. I've left off 1 of the 5 stars for 2 main reasons detailed in PRO's\\/CON's list below:\\nCONS:\\n1- Without (very) fresh batteries, the luminosity quoted in the product description isn't consistently provided by these lights- except on full, fresh batteries, the light is much dimmer than it can be when the light has fully powered batteries in it, so you'll end up going through batteries faster than normal (thankfully, the \\\"Amazon Basics\\\" AA batteries are very good quality & are very cheap compared to name-brands, so this is a solveable issue, just wasteful, seeing as you end up tossing batteries which still hold some charge- I've ended up using the 1\\/2 dead flashlight batteries in my cable box remotes in an effort not to waste them).\\n2- Like many of the economical flashlights being sold of this design type, sometimes the power-button press to cycle between modes happens without your input, turning on the strobe setting or the lower light output setting without my intending to do so by pressing the power button.\\nPROS:\\n1- These lights are very compact, yet with fully charged batteries, they have a high light output for their size. Given the amount of light they provide when fully powered, they do a good job to the point that my wife always keeps one in her purse & her car for being about at night &\\/or walking our dog after dark.\\n2- Unlike many of the other flashlights I've bought of this design\\/type, these lights have held up quality-wise over a decent amount of use- working just as they well as they did when they'd 1st arrived.\\n3- The price asked would be inexpensive for 1 CREE-type LED light of this design & high quality, so very good value for a 2 pack!\\n\\nOverall I certainly recommend them if you're looking for a good, low-cost & compact CREE-type LED, zoomable flashlight which works well & is of good quality..\"},{\"CustomerName\":\"Coconut eater\",\"Headline\":\"It's a great personal LED flashlight that easily fits into a pocket.\",\"Rating\":\"5.0 out of 5 stars\",\"Date\":\"on February 10, 2018\",\"Pattern\":\"Pattern: LED Flashlight 2P\",\"Comment\":\"Was this review helpful to you?\",\"TextRivew\":\"Tiny yet powerful and the battery charge seems to last a long time.\"},{\"CustomerName\":\"Dr. LRF, DPT\",\"Headline\":\"One battery and it lights up like a police helicopter\",\"Rating\":\"5.0 out of 5 stars\",\"Date\":\"on February 10, 2018\",\"Pattern\":\"Pattern: LED Flashlight 2P\",\"Comment\":\"Was this review helpful to you?\",\"TextRivew\":\"My husband is obsessed with this flashlight.

They are okay for throw away flash lights but they are very undependable and aren't really worth keeping for more than a week. I run a small business that requires me to constantly use a flash light and I bought these as a test run. After about a week they started going in and out. I replaced the batteries and still it only worked about 45% of the time. I'm not a picky person but these had a pretty bad short in their switch so I just kept them in a drawer and used them intermittently.

If you turn it off and on you will have bright light, dimmer light, and the strobe mode and it's somewhat annoying when you're trying to just use a damn flashlight and have to turn it off and on just to get the right light or at least not turn on in strobe mode.

The second light had an issue with the focusing collar. Extending the collar took a greater amount of effort over the first one and it snapped back upon releasing it. If there's an o-ring inside, it's too snug and is creating vacuum on extension. It doesn't snap back all the way leaving about one-eighth inch gap. The only way I could retract it all the way was by rotating the collar as I pressed down and as I pulled up. Eventually I could fully extend it and retract it with no issues. The same flashlight had a short issue with the switch. One day upon pressing the on-off button it flashed on momentarily then remained off. Pushing down on the button had no effect and the switch would not lock in position. It wouldn't even rotate to the next position. I Removed the switch portion from the main body and tapped it on a table and tried pressing again. No change. I eventually screwed the switch back figuring that it was broken. After screwing it back on I tried pushing the button one last time. It worked again! Probably some debris inside the switch worked free.

It's not a big deal, but it's a little annoying.\\n\\nI would give these 3 stars, but the good price point bumps it up to 4. I didn't pay much for these, so they're mostly worth the price.

There are 3 different modes: high beam, low beam and flashing and it only takes one AA battery. My son loves the handy built-in clip; he can clip the flashlight to his pant pocket, on his shirt or where ever it fancies him.

So I find myself looking for smaller but strong and bright flashlights. These led flashlights from rockbirds are the perfect choice for my family. They are small and very sturdy. Strong and very bright. There are what I would call 3 different modes of light. The first is a regular flashlight beam. This light is very bright and shows a long distance from the user. Next is a more.focused beam just pull on the flashlight and you get a smaller more focused beam of light in a square. Next is a flashing mode. I like this one best because I will take the dogs for a walk in the morning before it is light out and I can use this in flashing mode attach it to my jacket so that drivers can see me.\\nOverall I have been very impressed with the quality of this flashlight.

There is a sturdy pocket clip mounted to the side of the flashlights with two small screws. So far I haven't had any problems with the flashlights which seem to be pretty durable and are just what I expected.\"},{\"CustomerName\":\"MisterP\",\"Headline\":\"Awesome\",\"Rating\":\"5.0 out of 5 stars\",\"Date\":\"on March 6, 2017\",\"Pattern\":\"Pattern: LED Flashlight 2P\",\"Comment\":\"Was this review helpful to you?\",\"TextRivew\":\"No problems at all ,strong lil lights\"},{\"CustomerName\":\"Michael Mills\",\"Headline\":\"Great flashlight.\",\"Rating\":\"5.0 out of 5 stars\",\"Date\":\"on March 5, 2017\",\"Pattern\":\"Pattern: LED Flashlight 2P\",\"Comment\":\"Was this review helpful to you?\",\"TextRivew\":\"I use this flashlight for work.

The battery compartment has an O ring to keep moisture out. They are waterproof but not to be submerged in water but they will withstand rain.\\nThe beam is adjustable and you can see that in the video I provided to go with this review and I also show all 3 modes of lighting. All you need to do is slightly tap the on and off switch and it will change modes.\\nPlease watch the video to get a better idea of what I am talking about.

The housing at the end of the light slides in and out to adjust the beam, and there is a strobe setting on the light when you press the power button off and on again. Two lights come in the package. At first it seemed a little spendy for them when looking at their size, but as I have used it, and had it in my pocket, these are 20 times the light you get at a dollar store, or by spending less somewhere else. I bought 3 packs of 2. They have held up under the abuse my son's and friends dish out so far.
